## Commits and Releases

This repo follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Every PR title
must conform — it becomes the squash-merge commit message on `main` and drives automated releases.

### Allowed types

| Type       | When to use                          | Version bump (pre-1.0)     |

| `feat`     | New feature or capability            | MINOR (0.x → 0.x+1)       |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                              | PATCH (0.x.y → 0.x.y+1)   |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                   | none                       |

| `ci`       | CI/CD changes                        | none                       |

Append `!` after the type for breaking changes: `feat!: drop support for Python 3.9`

### Good PR title examples ✅

```
feat: add OAuth2 login flow
fix(api): handle empty response from search endpoint
chore: upgrade dependencies to latest
feat!: rename config file from .env to .app.env
docs: add setup guide for local development
```

### Bad PR title examples ❌

```
fixed stuff              # no type prefix
Feature/new-login        # branch name, not a commit message
WIP: auth changes        # not a Conventional Commits type
update code              # vague, no type
```

### How releases work

After a PR merges to `main`, release-please opens a Release PR within ~1 minute. Once all required
status checks pass on that PR, GitHub automatically squash-merges it — cutting the release,
tagging the version, and publishing the changelog. No manual merge step needed.
